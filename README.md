# Time-Series-Temperature-Forecasting-
The aim of the project is forecast temperature for each day in Delhi City ,India using time series forecasting methods
These monthly forecasts can then be further converted to daily temperatures as well. Along with this , the motive is to explore different components of time series and also study the relationship between Temperatures and other variables like Mean Pressure ,Humidity

1>,The relationship between Temperature and other variables need to be studied ,as this will give some clarity whether we can use any of those variables to forecast temperatures. Scatter Plots are created for each combination to explore the relationship.

2>:The STL components and ACF plots are  created to study the time sereis charactaeristics.

3>The ADF test(Augmented Dicky Fuller) test is utilized to find out if the time series is stationary or not.

4>. ARIMA(1, 0, 0) ,an AR modell with order 1, no differencing, and no moving average model is created to test the predictability of the time series.

5>ARIMA models, Holt Winters Model and Two Level Forecasting Models are created to do the preidtction.

6>Accuracy metrics used for selecting the based Models are MAPE and RMSE.
